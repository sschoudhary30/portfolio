This project handles gym management by storing and modifying gym and machine details, including adding or removing machines as needed. Customer information can be added, stored, and modified, with personalized schedules for efficient machine usage. Each gym offers two time slots daily, and customers are assigned machines for 15-minute intervals. The system ensures each person utilizes the gym for 1 hour per day. Gender inclusion is maintained across all gym sessions.
